These technologies enable precise measurement of speech parameters, personalized treatment planning, and automated progress tracking, ultimately improving therapeutic outcomes.",

Speech therapists utilize structured activities and multisensory approaches to enhance phonological processing skills, thereby supporting both speech production and reading comprehension."
